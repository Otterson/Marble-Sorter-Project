# Marble-Sorter-Project
This repository contains all the code used for the freshman engineering lego marble sorter project

The freshman year engineering project was designed to give students a challenge and teach them how to overcome obsticals and work
as a team on a semi-legitimate project. The objective was to build a machine that could sort marbles based on size, color and material
using Lego Mindstorm kits and other simple materials, such as cardboard or cardstock. A simple barcode designed to determine how
the marbles should be sorted was given to each group. The main components of the project to be designed and built by the students
were a barcode scanner, a marble identifier and a dispensing mechanism.
